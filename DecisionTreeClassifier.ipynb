For this example, have been provided with two datasets for training and testing- a training dataset (1400 samples) and a test dataset (327 samples). Pleased download datasets from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aka1ySucu1e3PqytQnVdEf63v9LT0E5z?usp=sharing). These samples represent the decisions of car experts regarding the acceptability of cars. The experts have categorized the cars into one of four classes: \"acceptable,\" \"unacceptable,\" \"good,\" or \"very good\" based on six categorical features.\n",

        "(Q.6., **10 Marks**): Now, let's create a function called \"tree_train\" to train the decision tree. This function begins by initializing the tree model and dataframe dictionary using the root node named \"node_1_1.\" It then iteratively updates these structures as it progresses through the tree, continuing until no further child nodes are generated. The process starts at level 1, and with each iteration, the level is incremented. Importantly, make sure to utilize the \"split_data\" function, which you've previously implemented, to assist in the tree construction. Ultimately, the function must return the fully trained tree model.\n",

This is due to the fact that reducing the threshold leads to training an under-fitted model as it isolated the outputs to a lower degree. This happens because when you lower threshold, nodes have a lower threshold they have to meet in order to become a leaf, which makes the model \"simipler\". Meanwhile, a higher threshold makes the model \"detailed\" as it has more splits. When the threshold is too high, it might result in over-fitting where the model is too specific to the training data and does not work well for the testing data. Hence, the ideal threshold will account for both under-fitting and over-fitting. For this specific case, we determined that the ideal threshold that yielded the highest result was ~0.8 which gave us a testing accuracy of about 93.3%.\n",
